# mcr-10.1_and_Novel_phoQ-_Mutation-Kenya-s_Colistin_Resistance-
**The first report of the mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr-10.1, in Kenya and a novel mutation in the phoQ gene (S244T) in a colistin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolate**

This repository aims to hone bioinformatics skills by utilizing data from the groundbreaking study on 'The Emergence of mcr-10.1 and phoQ Mutation in Colistin-Resistant Enterobacter cloacae Isolate from Kenya.' Through practical exercises, we delve into genomic analysis, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and variant identification, contributing to a deeper understanding of bacterial resistance mechanisms.
